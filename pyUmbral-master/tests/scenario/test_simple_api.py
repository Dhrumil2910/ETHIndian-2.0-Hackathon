    This test models the main interactions between NuCypher actors (i.e., Alice, 
    Bob, Data Source, and Ursulas) and artifacts (i.e., public and private keys,
    ciphertexts, capsules, KFrags, CFrags, etc). 

    The test covers all the main stages of data sharing with NuCypher:
    key generation, delegation, encryption, decryption by 
    Alice, re-encryption by Ursula, and decryption by Bob.
